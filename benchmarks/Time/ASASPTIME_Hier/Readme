--------------------------------------
INSTALLATION AND RUNNING ASASPTIME
--------------------------------------

The directory should include the following three folders:

- ASASPTIME: containing the implementation of ASASPTIME
- Testcases: benchmark problems, includes three sub-folders for experiments in the paper at SAC15.

The executables included here work under Ubuntu (e.g., 12.04 LTS). If you need executables for another operating system, please, let us know.

Notice that you need to download and install the SMT solver Yices, which is used as a backend reasoner by the MCMT model checker. You need to use version 1.0.xx not 2.0.xx!  You can dowload it at the following address: http://yices.csl.sri.com/download-old.shtml.


I. INSTALLATION

Before installing ASASPTIME
------------------------

- install g++: sudo apt-get install g++
- sudo apt-get install build-essential
- install m4:  sudo apt-get install m4
- install GMP:
     ./configure
     make

     Some self-tests can be run with

     make check

     And you can install (under /usr/local by default) with

     make install


- Installing Yices on Linux

	 Download version 1.0.xx of Yices and unpack the archive. You will find that the package contains three directories: lib, bin and include. You will have to copy the content to your /usr directory. You need to be administrator to do this. Via the terminal, you can do this by typing:

     cd folder_where_yices_is_unpacked
     sudo mv lib/* /usr/lib
     sudo mv include/* /usr/include
     sudo mv bin/* /usr/bin
     sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/yices


- Installing MCMT

	 Please visit http://users.mat.unimi.it/users/ghilardi/mcmt/ for the installation



Installing ASASPTIME
-----------------

- Install Python: in Ubuntu 12.04 Python 2.7.3 is already pre-installed? If not, please follow instruction on the internet for setting up Python or use:

     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev
     sudo apt-get install python

- Copy Folder ASASPTIME to the folder bin inside the MCMT



II. INVOKING ASASPTIME
---------------

1. Input file

- We use integers to represent Roles. For example: -5 means "not role5"
- We use 't' + integers to represent TimeSlots. For example: t3 means "the third timeslot"


The input file for ASASPTIME can be saved in any location and must follow the following form:

 [Hierarchies]
 hierarchy_rules
 [UA0]
 [Rules]
 can_assign/can_revoke/can_disable/can_enable

 where:
 * hierarchy_rules: a set of hierarchy rules, one rule in each line
  For example: we write:
      9>13>t1
	  14>12>t1
       meaning that role 9 is more sennnior than role 13 at timeslot t1; and role 14 is more senior than role 12 at timeslot t1

 * can_assign/can_revoke/can_disable/can_enable: administrative actions, one action in each line

 For example: we write:
      can_assign 5 , t8 , 2 -4 ; t1 , 8
       meaning that 5 is administrative role, 2 and -4 are the roles in the precondition, 8 is the target role, t8 is the rule timeslot, and t1 is the role timeslot

      Similarly to:
  	  can_revoke 3 , t8 , true ; t29 , 14
 	  can_enable 6 , t11 , 3 -8 ; t25 , 7
	  can_disable 5 , t23 , true ; t13 , 4


2. Running ASASPTIME

- Cd to folder ASASPTIME

- Type the following command to run the system

	./mainSystem.py testcaseFile ur_Mode max_num_of_roles max_num_of_time_slots role_index time_slot_index

   where
	*testcaseFile: the input file name
	*Mode: the security mapping used. Mode should be "Adapt", "Linear", or "Multi"
	*max_num_of_roles: a natural number indicating how many roles in the policy
	*max_num_of_time_slots: a natural number indicating how many timeslots in the policy
	*role_index: a natural number indicating the role in goal
	*time_slot_index: a natural number indicating the timeslot in goal



For example:
./mainSystem.py Testcase/test1 ur_Adapt 34 20 9 17 will run the system with test1 as the input file and Adapt as the security mapping
