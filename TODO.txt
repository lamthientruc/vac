Simplify:
    1. Change parser (done)
        - ARBAC data 
        - grammar file
    2. Add reduction method (done)
        - For NEW user mode
        - For goal user mode
    3. Change the log file (later)
    4. Change IO (done)

Translate:
    1. Change parser
    2. (no need to change the translation)

CounterExample:
    1. Change the parser
    2. Change the IO
        - Read log file
        - Read 
        - Remember when read the original ARBAC file, need to apply reduction on that file first.
    3. Change the producer
        - Map back NEW user
